When I got accepted it was the best day! I have had a great time here at Georgia and have also joined a sorority. I joined ΑΦ (Alpha Phi) my first semester of college. I have loved it so far and have met so many new people.

<P>My schedule pretty much stays the same through each week. I will sometimes work out more some weeks than others, but my classes stay the same and I try to go to all of them. 
I will also have different plans during the week involving friends, sorority or study groups. However, this is my pretty normal schedule.</P>
