<h1> Biography </h1>
<P> I was born in Atlanta, GA on March 10, 1999. I have always lived in Atlanta and hope to one day maybe return there. I am the second oldest of six children. There are five girls and one boy, who is the youngest.
I look just like my siblings and am always asked if any of my sisters are my twin. 
I have two dogs, Hera and Iris, who are German Shepherds. We got Iris about three years ago and got Hera about eleven years ago.
I have always been into sports, so I started playing soccer at the age of six. I have also played basketball, tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, swimming and ballet.
I went through a school system called Atlanta Public Schools from Elementary to High school. I went to Warren T Jackson Elementary School, then to Sutton Middle School and finally to <A href = "https://www.atlantapublicschools.us/northatlanta"> <button> North Atlanta High School.</button> </A>  I currently go to the University of Georgia.</P>
<h1> Life at Georgia </h1>
My family has always been huge <em> Georgia Bulldog </em> fans. My grandfather and mom went to Georgia, so I wanted to follow in their footsteps. My older sister also currently goes here.
When I got accepted it was probably one of the best days of my life! I have had a great time here at Georgia and have also joined a sorority. I joined ΑΦ (Alpha Phi) my first semester of college. I have loved it so far and have met so many new people.
Two of my best friends today are in the sorority with me. My older sister is also in the sorority, so I have a double sister. 
I am currently a business major. I am thinking about majoring in real estate, but I am not positive yet.
I have also learned more about what I want to do with my life and I am always trying new things!

<P>My schedule pretty much stays the same through each week. I will sometimes work out more some weeks than others, but my classes stay the same and I try to go to all of them. 
I will also have different plans during the week involving friends, sorority or study groups. However, this is my pretty normal schedule. I am always looking to try new things and to explore Athens more.
I also am looking to get a job sometime soon, because I need more experience and some money to save up. School has been pretty tough, so I have not been looking too much. I am nervous I will fall behind in school if I get a job.
I usually babysit when I go home for holidays, so that is what I am planning on doing this year. I am looking to maybe shadow one of my neighbors since he works in Real Estate to give me a better idea of what I want to do. 
This is showing how much my schedule is changing daily or monthly. </P>
